- Apply various artistic transformations (e.g., sketch, cartoon, etc.)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Jupyter Notebook

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. Open `img_to_others.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook cells to see image transformations.
3. Use your own images by replacing `sampleapple.jpg`.
